# Highlight API 

## Overview

### The Highlight API is designed to provide developers with tools to dynamically <em>**highlight**</em> elements on web pages. This can be used to draw user attention to specific content, mark items during user interactions, or as part of a larger user experience strategy.

<br/>

## Features enables Highlight API

### 1) Customizable Highlights: Set colors, borders, and animations for highlights.
### 2) Element Selection: Target specific DOM elements for highlighting.
### 3) Event-Driven Highlights: Trigger highlights based on user actions or other events.


## Additional knowledge
### What is the difference between *async* and *defer* attributes in script tag?

### 1) defer - boolean attribe which specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing. <br/> If you don't know which attribute use, use "defer"

### 2) async - the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as possible (before parsing completes)

### 3) if none of above attributes provided, the script will download and execute immediately. It will block parsing until the script is completely downloads.
