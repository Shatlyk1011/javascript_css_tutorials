## ECMAScript (всплытие)

  ### What is ECMAScript?
  ECMAScript (ES) is the official name for the JavaScript language standard. 
  JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript specification created by Netscape.
  It defines the language syntax, types, statements, keywords, and objects that any environment running JavaScript should implement, allowing developers to write standardized JavaScript code.

  In other words:
  `ECMAScript is a blueprint`
  `JavaScript is a house built according to that blueprint`.

  * ES1 (1997): The first edition of the ECMAScript standard.
  * ES3 (1999): Introduced many features that are fundamental to the language today.
  * ES5 (2009): Added `"strict mode"` `JSON support`, and `enhanced array manipulation functions`.
  * ES6/ES2015: A major update that introduced `classes, modules, arrow functions, promises`, and many other features, significantly changing JavaScript programming.
  * ES2016+: From 2016 onwards, ECMAScript adopted *an annual release cycle*, introducing new features in smaller, more manageable updates. Notable additions include *async/await (ES2017)*, *rest/spread properties (ES2018)*, *optional chaining*, and *nullish coalescing (ES2020)*.

  #### JavaScript may contain extensions that are not compatible with ECMAScript.
  #### Overall, ECMAScript is the foundation of JavaScript, but they are not exact copies of each other.

  ### Why ECMAScript? 
  * _Consistency_: ECMAScript ensures that JavaScript behaves consistently across different browsers and environments.
  * _Future-Proofing_: Following the standard helps developers write code that is more likely to be compatible with future versions of JavaScript.
  * _Cross-Platform Development_: Enables developers to build cross-platform applications with JavaScript, knowing that their code adheres to a widely supported standard.
  * _Innovation_: The standard evolves with the web, allowing new features and improvements to be adopted in a controlled manner.
