For ensuring maximum accessibility in HTML content, it's crucial to use semantic HTML elements correctly. These elements clearly describe their meaning in both the browser and the developer, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the content. Here are some key HTML elements and attributes that enhance accessibility:

<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>: These semantic elements help define the structure of the page, making it easier for assistive technologies to navigate and present content to users.

<h1> to <h6>: Proper use of heading elements creates a hierarchical structure for your content, making it easier for users to navigate through sections of the page.

<alt> attribute for <img>: Descriptive alt text for images allows screen readers to convey the content of images to users who cannot see them.

<label> for <input> elements: Labels are essential for form controls as they indicate the purpose of each input field to assistive technologies.

<button> and <a>: Use buttons for actions and links for navigation. Ensure that the text content of each clearly describes its purpose or destination.

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and properties: ARIA roles, states, and properties allow you to make more complex web content and applications accessible. For example, using role="button" for elements acting as buttons but not marked up as <button>.

<lang> attribute: Specifying the language of the page or parts of it with the lang attribute helps screen readers pronounce content correctly.

<table> with <th> and <caption>: Properly marked-up tables with header cells (<th>) and captions describe the context and structure of table data to users of screen readers.

Contrast and font size: Ensuring high contrast between text and background colors and providing a mechanism to increase font size helps users with visual impairments.

Keyboard navigation: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible and usable with a keyboard alone, without requiring a mouse.

Incorporating these elements and attributes into your HTML will greatly enhance the accessibility of your web content, making it usable for as wide an audience as possible.
